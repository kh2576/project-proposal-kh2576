# Project title
What To Cook

# What and why?
40% of all food in the US is wasted. Ever want to cook using leftover ingredients but not sure what you're able to make? What to Cook is a simple web application that allows a user to input whatever they have in their fridge/pantry, and returns a list of recipes that the user is able to cook with their existing ingredients, or at least requires minimal shopping to complete the full recipe. This not only reduces waste but also helps save money and time otherwise spent pouring over recipe books or Google searches to find the perfect recipe for your needs. 

# For whom?
Environmentally-conscious consumers, Home-cooks, mainly amateurs

#How?
The opening interface page would have a single search box that allows users to input keywords such as "milk" or "linguini", and then add it to a list of the ingredients that the user currently possesses. There will also be checkboxes and drop down menus for the user to filter criteria of the resulting recipes, such as cook time, dietary restrictions, and calories. Once the user submits all this information, he/she will be redirected to a webpage where a list of recipes that are able to be completed via existing ingredients will be shown. If none or few recipes fit the criteria or ingredients assigned, the application will also return recipes that require minimal incremental ingredients to complete, as well as note the number of missing ingredients for easy comprehension. 

# Scope
In terms of ease/simplicity, the project's paramteres can be modified to accomodate a higher or lower degree of difficulty and work for students over the semester. For example, the breadth of recipes can be configured to either scraping a single cooking website to several. Ingredient ambiguity is also an issue, and the degree of natural language processing to address differences between "chicken" or "poultry" can prove challenging.
